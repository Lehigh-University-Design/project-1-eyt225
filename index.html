         <p>The first photograph ever uploaded to the internet was posted by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, in 1992. The photo is a scanned image of a parody band called "Les Horribles Cernettes," and it was uploaded to the web on July 18, 1992. The image was used to test the functionality of the web and demonstrate the capabilities of a web browser at the time. "Les Horribles Cernettes" was a group of female researchers and administrative staff working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

            <p>This was the first video posted to YouTube. "Me at the Zoo," was uploaded to YouTube on April 23, 2005. The video features Jawed Karim, one of the co-founders of YouTube, standing in front of elephants at the San Diego Zoo and discussing their trunks. This upload marked the beginning of the era of online video sharing and played a significant role in the growth and popularity of YouTube as a platform.
